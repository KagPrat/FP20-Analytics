I am participating in FP20 Analytics Challenge 19 - E-commerce KPI analysis. I have designed a two-page dashboard that focuses on the finance and market aspects of the data.

Both dashboards show:

Annual Profit Growth
Total Sales Growth
Total Corporate Sales Growth
Total Sales per Market.

Key Findings:

- 2020, 2021, and 2023 had a profit margin above 15% with 2021 having the greatest profit margin at 18.5%.
- All years showed a total sales growth from the previous year above or equal to 20% with 2023 having the highest dollar growth amount at $421,897 and 2022 having the highest percentage growth at 26.0%
- No years showed a total sales growth from the previous year above or equal to 30% with 2023 having the highest dollar growth amount at $253,042 and 2022 having the highest percentage growth at 26.6%
- 4/5 of the global markets reach an amount above or equal to $400k by 2023, with the highest market being Asia Pacific at $606,179 and the lowest being LATAM at $434,586. The Africa market remains at $163,624.



On my finance dashboard, I focused on:

- Top 10 Customers Average Spending
- Profit Distribution in World Map
- Country Profit Distribution by Category
- Market Profits since 2020
- Segments Profits since 2020
- Discount Percentage Count Relative to Profit Trends

Key Findings:

- The top 10 customers spent between $3.82K and $2.55K, with 2 from the US.
- Central US, Western Europe, and Central America dominate in profit.
- US leads profit in all categories except Home and Accessories, where Mexico dominates.
- A correlation exists between low discounts (0%-20%) and higher profits.

On my market dashboard, I focused on:

Segment Quantity Trends

- Best Seller of Categories/Subcategories/Products since 2020
- Top 10 Highest Spending Customers in each Country
- Market Profit/Sales Distribution
- Market Categories/Subcategories/Products Profit/Sales since 2020

Key Findings:

- Body Care is the best-selling category (2K products), while Face Care is the lowest (231 products).
- The Herbal Essence Bio product leads with 2K units sold.
- US customers consistently spend the most.
- Profit trends slowed or decreased in 2022, despite sales growth.
